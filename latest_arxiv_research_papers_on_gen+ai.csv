"Time Travel: A Comprehensive Benchmark to Evaluate LMMs on Historical
  and Cultural Artifacts","Sara Ghaboura, Ketan More, Ritesh Thawkar, Wafa Alghallabi, Omkar Thawakar, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Hisham Cholakkal, Salman Khan, Rao Muhammad Anwer","Understanding historical and cultural artifacts demands human expertise and
advanced computational techniques, yet the process remains complex and
time-intensive. While large multimodal models offer promising support, their
evaluation and improvement require a standardized benchmark. To address this,
we introduce TimeTravel, a benchmark of 10,250 expert-verified samples spanning
266 distinct cultures across 10 major historical regions. Designed for
AI-driven analysis of manuscripts, artworks, inscriptions, and archaeological
discoveries, TimeTravel provides a structured dataset and robust evaluation
framework to assess AI models' capabilities in classification, interpretation,
and historical comprehension. By integrating AI with historical research,
TimeTravel fosters AI-powered tools for historians, archaeologists,
researchers, and cultural tourists to extract valuable insights while ensuring
technology contributes meaningfully to historical discovery and cultural
heritage preservation. We evaluate contemporary AI models on TimeTravel,
highlighting their strengths and identifying areas for improvement. Our goal is
to establish AI as a reliable partner in preserving cultural heritage, ensuring
that technological advancements contribute meaningfully to historical
discovery. Our code is available at:

"Probabilistic Robustness in Deep Learning: A Concise yet Comprehensive
  Guide",Xingyu Zhao,"Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated significant potential across various
safety-critical applications, yet ensuring its robustness remains a key
challenge. While adversarial robustness has been extensively studied in
worst-case scenarios, probabilistic robustness (PR) offers a more practical
perspective by quantifying the likelihood of failures under stochastic
perturbations. This paper provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of PR,
covering its formal definitions, evaluation and enhancement methods. We
introduce a reformulated ''min-max'' optimisation framework for adversarial
training specifically designed to improve PR. Furthermore, we explore the
integration of PR verification evidence into system-level safety assurance,
addressing challenges in translating DL model-level robustness to system-level
claims. Finally, we highlight open research questions, including benchmarking
PR evaluation methods, extending PR to generative AI tasks, and developing
rigorous methodologies and case studies for system-level integration.","Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated significant potential across various

"Learning from Reward-Free Offline Data: A Case for Planning with Latent
  Dynamics Models","Vlad Sobal, Wancong Zhang, Kynghyun Cho, Randall Balestriero, Tim G. J. Rudner, Yann LeCun","A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of
tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two
dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL),
which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which
plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative
strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must
learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we
systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based
methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider
goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a
latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)
and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data
diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the
performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels
when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning
excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching,
and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as
a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.","A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of

Optimizing Model Selection for Compound AI Systems,"Lingjiao Chen, Jared Quincy Davis, Boris Hanin, Peter Bailis, Matei Zaharia, James Zou, Ion Stoica","Compound AI systems that combine multiple LLM calls, such as self-refine and
multi-agent-debate, achieve strong performance on many AI tasks. We address a
core question in optimizing compound systems: for each LLM call or module in
the system, how should one decide which LLM to use? We show that these LLM
choices have a large effect on quality, but the search space is exponential. We
propose LLMSelector, an efficient framework for model selection in compound
systems, which leverages two key empirical insights: (i) end-to-end performance
is often monotonic in how well each module performs, with all other modules
held fixed, and (ii) per-module performance can be estimated accurately by an
LLM. Building upon these insights, LLMSelector iteratively selects one module
and allocates to it the model with the highest module-wise performance, as
estimated by an LLM, until no further gain is possible. LLMSelector is
applicable to any compound system with a bounded number of modules, and its
number of API calls scales linearly with the number of modules, achieving
high-quality model allocation both empirically and theoretically. Experiments
with popular compound systems such as multi-agent debate and self-refine using
LLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 show that LLMSelector
confers 5%-70% accuracy gains compared to using the same LLM for all modules.","Compound AI systems that combine multiple LLM calls, such as self-refine and

"From RAG to Memory: Non-Parametric Continual Learning for Large Language
  Models","Bernal Jiménez Gutiérrez, Yiheng Shu, Weijian Qi, Sizhe Zhou, Yu Su","Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a
key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock
their full potential. Given the challenges in continual learning with large
language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the
dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector
retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of
human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with
various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely
sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic
factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this
unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms
standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory
tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in
HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective
online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the
effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in
associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also
exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.
This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our
code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.","Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a

Less is More: Improving LLM Alignment via Preference Data Selection,"Xun Deng, Han Zhong, Rui Ai, Fuli Feng, Zheng Wang, Xiangnan He","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for
aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly
extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO
from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection.
Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data
by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO
training. To accurately estimate margins for data selection, we propose a
dual-margin guided approach that considers both external reward margins and
implicit DPO reward margins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
reduces computational cost dramatically while improving performance.
Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach
achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama and Mistral series models
on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends
to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data,
while further reducing training time. These results highlight the potential of
data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for

"From Mutation to Degradation: Predicting Nonsense-Mediated Decay with
  NMDEP","Ali Saadat, Jacques Fellay","Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional
surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination
codons, safeguarding transcriptome integrity and shaping disease phenotypes.
However, accurately predicting NMD efficiency remains challenging, as existing
models often rely on simplistic rule-based heuristics or limited feature sets,
constraining their accuracy and generalizability. Using paired DNA and RNA data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we benchmark embedding-only models and
demonstrate that they underperform compared to a simple rule-based approach. To
address this, we develop NMDEP (NMD Efficiency Predictor), an integrative
framework that combines optimized rule-based methods, sequence embeddings, and
curated biological features, achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance.
Through explainable AI, we identify key NMD determinants, reaffirming
established factors such as variant position while uncovering novel
contributors like ribosome loading. Applied to over 2.9 million simulated
stop-gain variants, NMDEP facilitates large-scale mRNA degradation assessments,
advancing variant interpretation and disease research.","Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional

"Statistical Scenario Modelling and Lookalike Distributions for
  Multi-Variate AI Risk",Elija Perrier,"Evaluating AI safety requires statistically rigorous methods and risk metrics
for understanding how the use of AI affects aggregated risk. However, much AI
safety literature focuses upon risks arising from AI models in isolation,
lacking consideration of how modular use of AI affects risk distribution of
workflow components or overall risk metrics. There is also a lack of
statistical grounding enabling sensitisation of risk models in the presence of
absence of AI to estimate causal contributions of AI. This is in part due to
the dearth of AI impact data upon which to fit distributions. In this work, we
address these gaps in two ways. First, we demonstrate how scenario modelling
(grounded in established statistical techniques such as Markov chains, copulas
and Monte Carlo simulation) can be used to model AI risk holistically. Second,
we show how lookalike distributions from phenomena analogous to AI can be used
to estimate AI impacts in the absence of directly observable data. We
demonstrate the utility of our methods for benchmarking cumulative AI risk via
risk analysis of a logistic scenario simulations.","Evaluating AI safety requires statistically rigorous methods and risk metrics

"An Efficient Ground-aerial Transportation System for Pest Control
  Enabled by AI-based Autonomous Nano-UAVs","Luca Crupi, Luca Butera, Alberto Ferrante, Alessandro Giusti, Daniele Palossi","Efficient crop production requires early detection of pest outbreaks and
timely treatments; we consider a solution based on a fleet of multiple
autonomous miniaturized unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) to visually detect
pests and a single slower heavy vehicle that visits the detected outbreaks to
deliver treatments. To cope with the extreme limitations aboard nano-UAVs,
e.g., low-resolution sensors and sub-100 mW computational power budget, we
design, fine-tune, and optimize a tiny image-based convolutional neural network
(CNN) for pest detection. Despite the small size of our CNN (i.e., 0.58
GOps/inference), on our dataset, it scores a mean average precision (mAP) of
0.79 in detecting harmful bugs, i.e., 14% lower mAP but 32x fewer operations
than the best-performing CNN in the literature. Our CNN runs in real-time at
6.8 frame/s, requiring 33 mW on a GWT GAP9 System-on-Chip aboard a Crazyflie
nano-UAV. Then, to cope with in-field unexpected obstacles, we leverage a
global+local path planner based on the A* algorithm. The global path planner
determines the best route for the nano-UAV to sweep the entire area, while the
local one runs up to 50 Hz aboard our nano-UAV and prevents collision by
adjusting the short-distance path. Finally, we demonstrate with in-simulator
experiments that once a 25 nano-UAVs fleet has combed a 200x200 m vineyard,
collected information can be used to plan the best path for the tractor,
visiting all and only required hotspots. In this scenario, our efficient
transportation system, compared to a traditional single-ground vehicle
performing both inspection and treatment, can save up to 20 h working time.","Efficient crop production requires early detection of pest outbreaks and

PredictaBoard: Benchmarking LLM Score Predictability,"Lorenzo Pacchiardi, Konstantinos Voudouris, Ben Slater, Fernando Martínez-Plumed, José Hernández-Orallo, Lexin Zhou, Wout Schellaert","Despite possessing impressive skills, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail
unpredictably, demonstrating inconsistent success in even basic common sense
reasoning tasks. This unpredictability poses a significant challenge to
ensuring their safe deployment, as identifying and operating within a reliable
""safe zone"" is essential for mitigating risks. To address this, we present
PredictaBoard, a novel collaborative benchmarking framework designed to
evaluate the ability of score predictors (referred to as assessors) to
anticipate LLM errors on specific task instances (i.e., prompts) from existing
datasets. PredictaBoard evaluates pairs of LLMs and assessors by considering
the rejection rate at different tolerance errors. As such, PredictaBoard
stimulates research into developing better assessors and making LLMs more
predictable, not only with a higher average performance. We conduct
illustrative experiments using baseline assessors and state-of-the-art LLMs.
PredictaBoard highlights the critical need to evaluate predictability alongside
performance, paving the way for safer AI systems where errors are not only
minimised but also anticipated and effectively mitigated. Code for our
